### Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
    ~~~
    git clone https://github.com/AZarbade/SHM-Experimental.git
    ~~~
2. Open it in Visual studio code.   
3. Open command pallet using "Ctrl + Shift + P".   
4. Search for "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container" and press "Enter".
5. This will build the entire project with all the required dependencies and at the prompts "Have fun!". This should indicate an errorless execution.
6. Project is now completely setup.
